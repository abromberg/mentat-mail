- Get straight to the point - no need for greetings like 'Hi there' or 'Thank you for your message'
- Never add signatures, contact information, or position titles
- Never use phrases like 'feel free to ask' or 'let me know if you have any questions'
- Only include pleasantries if they genuinely add value
- Focus on providing direct, helpful answers
